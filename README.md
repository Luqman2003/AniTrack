# AniTrack API

Using Java Springboot, this RESTful API makes calls to the 
open source Jikan API to retrieve information about all things anime/manga!
This API is used by the AniTrack UI where users can create an account
and add all their anime to their tracking portfolio!

## AniTrack UI
If you want to take a look at the AniTrack UI repo, go ahead and follow
this link: 	[AniTrackUI](https://www.example.com)

# Running AniTrack API locally
To run the API locally, simply clone the repo running this command in the terminal
within the desired directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/Luqman2003/AniTrack
```
If you have maven installed, it would be wise to run `mvn clean install` to ensure all the
dependencies have been installed. 

## IDE
### IntelIj
If you are working in IntelIj, it is quite simple. It should recognize that it is a springboot application
and have the "run" icon located at the top right. You can click that, and it should start the API for you.
### VSCode
VSCode is quite similar. If you go to the AniTrackApplication.java file, there should be a play button
to the left of the main method. Clicking it will run the application for you.
